average num of NON ZERO data points for certain hashes excluding 0 rows, lower limit of 100
    remove 'where num !=0' to include datapoints where num=0
    remove 'where T.c>100' to include hashes with less than 100 clicks (during recording)

select avg(T.c)
from (select count(*) as c
    from clicks
    where num !=0
    group by hash) as T
where T.c>100;
